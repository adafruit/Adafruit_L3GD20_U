## Adafruit Unified L3GD20 Driver ##

This unified sensor driver is for use with any STM Triple-Axis Gyro that is register compatible with the L3GD20, including the L3G4200D and others.  It has been tested on the Adafruit Triple-Axis Gyro sensor and the Adafruit 10DOF Breakout, and has been designed specifically for these boards:

Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams 

The updated 'Unified' sensor driver (based on Adafruit's Sensor API) use I2C to communicate.  If you need to use SPI on the L3GD20, please look at the original (non unified) driver that is still available here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_L3GD20

## What is the Adafruit Unified Sensor Library? ##

The Adafruit Unified Sensor Library ([Adafruit_Sensor](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)) provides a common interface and data type for any supported sensor.  It defines some basic information about the sensor (sensor limits, etc.), and returns standard SI units of a specific type and scale for each supported sensor type.

It provides a simple abstraction layer between your application and the actual sensor HW, allowing you to drop in any comparable sensor with only one or two lines of code to change in your project (essentially the constructor since the functions to read sensor data and get information about the sensor are defined in the base Adafruit_Sensor class).

This is imporant useful for two reasons:

1.) You can use the data right away because it's already converted to SI units that you understand and can compare, rather than meaningless values like 0..1023.

2.) Because SI units are standardised in the sensor library, you can also do quick sanity checks when working with new sensors, or drop in any comparable sensor if you need better sensitivity or if a lower cost unit becomes available, etc. 

Light sensors will always report units in lux, gyroscopes will always report units in rad/s, etc. ... freeing you up to focus on the data, rather than digging through the datasheet to understand what the sensor's raw numbers really mean.

## Adding support for other models ##

When constructed with no parameters, this driver interacts with the L3GD20 via I2C.  To use with the L3G4200D, simply construct as follows:

```Adafruit_L3GD20_Unified gyro = Adafruit_L3GD20_Unified(20, L3G4200D_type);```

To implement support for other register compatible gyros (perhaps the L3G3200D), simply initialize a ```gyro_type``` struct with the appropriate register addresses and device specific values, and pass that to the ```Adafruit_L3GD20_Unified``` constructor in place of the ```L3G4200D_type``` constant.  See [Adafruit_L3GD20_U.h](Adafruit_L3GD20_U.h) for an example.
